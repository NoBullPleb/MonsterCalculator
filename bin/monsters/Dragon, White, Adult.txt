Traits
Ice Walk, The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally
difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra moment.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day), If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Actions
Multiattack, The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks, one with its bite and two with its
claws.
Bite ­ Melee Weapon Attack
+11 to hit, reach 10 ft, one target.
Hit, 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.
Claw ­ Melee Weapon Attack
+11 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target.
Hit, 15 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.
Tail ­ Melee Weapon Attack
+11 to hit, reach 15 ft, one target.
Hit, 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
Frightful Presence, Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must
succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the
effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
Cold Breath (Recharge 5–6), The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60­foot cone. Each creature in that line must make
a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be
used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of
its turn.
Detect, The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
Tail Attack, The dragon makes a tail attack.
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions), The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed
on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can
then fly up to half its flying speed.
