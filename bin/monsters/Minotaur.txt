Traits
Labyrinthine Recall, The minotaur can perfectly recall any path it has traveled.
Charge, If the minotaur moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same
turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength
saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.
Reckless, At the start of its turn, the minotaur can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that
turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.
